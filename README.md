# Unit 2 | Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background
This is a homework assignment I completed during a Data Analytics bootcamp run by the University of California, Irvine. I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

### Stock market analyst

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### CHALLENGE

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet just by running it once.

* This can be applied to any of the difficulties.

### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over again with a click of the button.
